        Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic operations of
        persistent storage. CRUD is also sometimes used to describes user
        interface for conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and
        changing information using computer-based forms and reports. The term
        was likely first popularized by James Martin in his 1983 book Managing
        the Data-base environment.
